# Overview

This manual will serve as the primary documentation for running the hitachi
to help in the analysis of Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (FNIRS)
data collected according to the MIND lab Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).
This manual, together with the scripts provided by this manual's author, should
help researchers at the MIND lab and elsewhere easily be able to generate their
own data files for the experiments they run using FNIRS equipment.
