# Overview:

This section of the MIND lab manual will teach researchers at the lab how to best make use of the
BIOPAC MP-150 data acquisition tool.

## What Sensors Does BIOPAC Support?

The BIOPAC supports a wide range of physiological sensors. Currently at the mind lab we use the
MP-150 for data collection for these sensors:

- ECG
- EDA
- PPG
- RESP (Respiration Rate)

In the future we hope to add more sensors to the repertoire. When such a time comes this section of
the mnaual will be updated to reflect those changes.

## Setting Up For Data Collection:

The BIOPAC sensors for the MP-150 work wirelessly and as such you will need two separate pieces
of hardware in order to get a signal from the sensor.

The first piece of hardware is the wireless receiver for the particular sensor you are trying to
record. These wireless receivers click into the main MP-150 hardware and are able to gather the signal
that is recored from the sensors attached to the participant.

### EDA

### ECG

### EEG

### Respiration Rate

## Marking BIOPAC Data:

For a more robust guide to setting up the MP-150 hardware as well as software for marking data please
refer to the `README.md` in this repo at:

`cfilemanual/marksmanual/`

# Scripts:

There are currently no scripts needed in order to operate the MP-150 or AcqKnowledge software.
